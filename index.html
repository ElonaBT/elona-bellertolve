<h1>Hello, I'm Elona !</h1>

			<p> 
				Hi everyone ! I’m Elona Baller-Tolve, an 18-year-old French national coming from the vibrant city of Paris.   Currently, I am studying  at ESSEC, pursuing the Global BBA with a focus on the English track. This choice reflects my global outlook and my ambition to make a significant impact in the world. Through my studies, I aim to deepen my understanding of international business dynamics while continuing to engage with the global issues that inspire me.

		<h2> My first passion is sport in general but mostly Handball</h2> 
		<p> My passion for sports runs deep, inherited from my father, a former rugby player whose tales of determination and teamwork have always inspired me. I chose handball as my field, dedicating over ten years to the sport as a goalkeeper. My journey has been filled with hard work and remarkable achievements, including leading my team to win the French Junior Championship.

Being part of the Paris 2024 Junior Team and competing in international tournaments have been highlights of my career. These experiences have not only sharpened my skills but also allowed me to represent my city and country on a global stage, continuing the legacy of my father’s passion for sports.

			<h2> My second passion is cars and the automobile sector </h2>
			<p> I have a profound passion for cars, especially vintage ones, which I see as pieces of art. This love guides my role as the Head of Events at GranTurismo Essec (GT-E), an association at my school focused on automobile art and racing. Leading this position is incredibly meaningful to me. I'm responsible for crafting events and managing a 15-person team, blending my love for automotive heritage with my skills in leadership and event planning. It's a role that perfectly captures my enthusiasm for the elegance and history of cars.

			<h2> My third passion consists of a mix of politics, sociologics and philosophie </h2>
			<p> I've always been fascinated by philosophy and the factors shaping societal behavior, including habitus, history, and religion. This passion for understanding society's intricacies led me to devour philosophical texts and journals. In high school, I co-founded a journal called "Le Cygne Déchaîné" with classmates and teachers, where we explored and shared our thoughts on French politics and societal issues. This project was a direct outlet for my interest, allowing me to engage deeply with the topics I'm passionate about.
